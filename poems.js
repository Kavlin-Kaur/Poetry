      slug: "two-parallel-worlds",
      content: `Living in two parallel worlds, perhaps there was a verse
  A verse that only my heart could find, and the one that my mind denied.
  Two worlds, two minds, two hearts, and yet, they intertwine.
  
  A city girl blinded by her dreams, rushing through the streets beneath the daylight's beam,
  A countryside girl, living a still life, with nothing but the love that abides.
  A life full of ambition, or a life full of soul—
  How can I balance them both?
  
  A girl who desires nothing but independence, to stand on her own,
  And a girl who seeks nothing but the warmth of the sun, to forget the world's wrongs.
  A girl who craves adventure, who loves the thrill,
  While another seeks nothing but stillness in the hills.
  
  Maybe I want more. Maybe I long for something that calms my soul,
  A place where both dreams and peace can coexist.
  Is it too much to ask for a life that encompasses all of this?
  To live freely, yet with depth, to chase ambition while finding tranquility in this ebb`

      content: `A girl like binary sort  
    But one you'll never solve.  
    For as you try to fix the code,  
    You'll wish you'd never got involved.  
    
    As complex as the depths of DSA,  
    My thoughts don't stay just one way.  
    Who was I? What was I not?  
    Fighting battles with every thought.  
    
    Unique like my name, my stream of mind,  
    Not someone you'll ever define.  
    You can trace me like a company's tree,  
    But wait until you truly see.  
    One by one, my steps unfold,  
    You like me for a bit, but never the whole.  
    
    Debug won't help, not this time.  
    Error logs scream louder than rhyme.  
    And still...  
    These lungs, they keep me awake  
    A heartbeat I can no longer fake.`

      title: "Grief",
      slug: "grief",
      content: `The nights were heavy with tears of the past,
  Was it the love we shared or the shadow that we cast?
  I wasn't all right, and you weren't all wrong,
  Perhaps we both fought battles unknown all along.
  
  Our youthful years, laced with sorrow and strain,
  Maybe I wasn't enough, or you felt no chain.
  You gave her the place where I longed to be
  How could you choose her, forgetting me?
  
  I gasped for air beneath heartache's tide,
  I forgave you once, then twice but you lied.
  Your words and your actions never aligned,
  And slowly, love faded from my heart and mind.
  
  What we once were, we can never be,
  My heart now carries those scars silently.
  Yet somehow, it longs for the you that I knew
  A ghost of a love that never stayed true.
  
  Years have passed, and life moves on,
  But deep in my chest, the ache lingers on.`,

      title: "I'll Bloom Anyway",
      slug: "ill-bloom-anyway",
      content: `Bottled-up emotions of despair and agony,  
    They whisper loud in this quiet cacophony.  
    Is it fine for me to stay in this ebony?  
    A darkness I wear like it's a part of me.  
    
    Words like resilience and fleeting felicity  
    Crack under the weight of my own anxiety.  
    Hope slips through fingers too tired to fight,  
    Yet I keep walking through the absence of light.  
    
    I don't reach out, I don't complain,  
    I carry the silence, I carry the pain.  
    Maybe the world won't notice I stayed,  
    But I'll bloom in the cracks where I once decayed...`,

      title: "Storm of Wrath",
      slug: "storm-of-wrath",
      content: `My mind was in a storm of wrath
  For everything he did, everything he brought.
  Maybe I was weak,
  Maybe I was wrecked,
  But didn't I say—
  Being with me would only bring havoc?`,

    {
      title: "Unloved",
      slug: "unloved",
      content: `Maybe it wasn't me—maybe it was the hurt in me.  
    Love never came easy, not sure why,  
    Was it my childhood or our last goodbye?
    
    Maybe it was my story left half-told,  
    Or the way I broke before I got to hold.  
    Fear grew loud and took over the good,  
    My doubts ruined more than I ever understood.
    
    Every time something came close to that pain,  
    I panicked, overthought, started the same game.  
    Loving and leaving, leaving and loving—was all just the same,  
    It made me panic to my stomach, the patterns that repeat.
    
    How should I behave? What shouldn't I repeat?  
    Thoughts crept in my mind, and when I had the courage  
    To speak my heart—they waved their goodbyes.  
    People came, they stayed, they saw, they ran.
    
    What should I do? How should I process?  
    Was I a maniac, or was I too hard to impress?  
    How do I make them see that I was trying my best?  
    Maybe love was never meant for this maniac.`,

      title: "Maybe This Is Alright",
      slug: "maybe-this-is-alright",
      content: `My sanity just got disrupted  
    Something inside my heart was irrupted  
    Filled with rage and vengeance,  
    Mere words played their cruel sentence  
    
    Detesting the company of my peer, but  
    sometimes I wish someone was here  
    Became a confidant to many,  
    yet desolation was my only company  
    
    Pondering over the things I can't get right  
    All messed up deep inside  
    Maybe this is insane, maybe this is alright  
    Deep down, I wish I was doing this life right...`,

      title: "Calling You",
      slug: "calling-you",
      content: `Every ounce of my heart calls your name  
    Just to take me back to that frame  
    Where love existed and I wasn't a fool  
    Where you existed and it wasn't about your muse  
    
    Where I loved you and you loved me back  
    Where we were a happy couple brat  
    But now that you've gone  
    I've realised the flowers don't smell no more  
    
    Where love songs don't hit no more  
    Where the cupid has died and fate is driven  
    Where I am dancing without your rhythm  
    Where I dress up but it doesn't feel right  
    
    Where stars shine but I don't look twice  
    Where every thought is about you  
    Where I am not happy, but I am not calling you!!`,
